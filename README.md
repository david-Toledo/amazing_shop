The Amazing GA Shop
=================================================================================

This is my 2nd project in GA and it was created in early December.

With COVID changing the way how we live the e-shops are necessary for any business to keep growing.

This e-shop project use CRUD operations, associations, authorisation and authentication systems in Ruby on rails.

This is a basic model where users can be created, users can log in, log out and select different items and add them in their shopping cart.
